Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Feature Selection/Extraction of Music Dataset

The goal of this exploratory data science project is to answer the simple question: what makes a song popular, given attributes of: Duration
Acousticness, Danceability, Energy, Instrumentalness, Key, Liveness, Audio Mode (Major = 1, Minor = 0...someone musically inclined should explain this to the class), Loudness, Speechiness, Tempo, Time Signature (meter signature), and Audio Valence (how positive/happy/cheerful a song is)?

This would be the first step in creating a nueral network because of feature extraction. 

In this project, we do everything from explore the metadata, to pre-process the data, to analyze/visualize correlation heatmaps, scatterplots, pivot tables, and boxplots.
